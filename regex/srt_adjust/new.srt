1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,067

2
00:00:02,777 --> 00:00:05,771
Kids, I'm going to tell you an incredible story.

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,323
the story of how I met your mother.

4
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:10,164
Are we being punished for something?

5
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:11,278
No.

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,789
-Is this going to take a while?
-Yes.

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,835
25 years ago, before I was dad,
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:20,891

9
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:22,130

10
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:24,952
It was way back to 2005.

11
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:30,562
I was 27ï¼Œjust starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with Marshal, my best friend from college.

12
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,114
My life was good, and then uncle Marshal went to screw the whole thing up.

13
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:36,846
Will you marry me?

14
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,280
Yes, perfect, and you're engaged.

15
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:43,476
You pop up the champagne. You drink a toast. You have sex on the kitchen floor.

16
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,327
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

17
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:46,282
Got it.

18
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,063
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

19
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:50,241
Are you kidding? It's you and Lily!

20
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:52,421
I've been there for all the big moment of you and Lily.

21
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:55,031
The night you met, your first date,

22
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:56,733
other first things.

23
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,728
Sorry, we thought you were asleep.

24
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,245
It's physics, Marshal. If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.

25
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,404
My God!

26
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,921
You're getting engaged tonight!

27
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:10,664
Yeah.

28
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,070
What are you doing tonight?

29
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,441
What was I doing?

30
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:17,888
Your uncle Marshal was taking the biggest step of his life. And me?

31
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,740
I'm calling up your uncle Barney.

32
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,734
Hey, see, you know, however, I thought I had a thing for half Asian girls?

33
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,944
Well, now I've got a new favourite,

34
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:27,850
Lebanese girls.

35
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,197
Lebanese girls are the new half Asians.

36
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,530
Hey, you want to do something tonight?

37
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,518
OK, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes,

38
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,248
and suit up!

39
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:38,871
Hey.

40
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,598
Where is your suit?

41
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,595
-Just once when I say 'suit up', I wish you'd put on a suit.
-I did, that one time.

42
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:46,743
It was a blazer.

43
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:51,261
You know, ever since college it's been Marshal and Lily and me.

44
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:54,410
Now it's going to be Marshal and Lily, and me.

45
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:55,950
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,267
Before long I'm that weird, middle-aged bechalor, their kids call 'uncle Ted'.

47
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:03,801
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:06,004
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?

49
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,612
Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live.

50
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:13,303
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:14,583
Oh, alright.

52
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:15,115
Alright.

53
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,844
Lesson one, lose the goatee.

54
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,022
It doesn't go with your suit.

55
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:20,592
-I'm not wearing a suit.
-Lesson two, get a suit.

56
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,537
Suits are cool, exhibitive.

57
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:27,471
Lesson 3, don't even think about getting married till you're 30.

58
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:29,722
30, right, you're right.

59
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,952
I guess that just your best friends get engaged, you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,200
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,738
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:39,809
-You're my best friend, Barney.
-Good,

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,615
and as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game I'd like to call

64
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:45,777
-'have you met Ted'.
-No, we are not playing 'have you met Ted.'

65
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:46,601
Hi, have you met Ted?

66
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,038
Hi!

67
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,227
I'm Ted.

68
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,375
Yasmin.

69
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:52,410
It's a very pretty name.

70
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,213
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

71
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,728
I'm exhausted. It was finger painting day at school.

72
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,663
A 5-year-old boy got to second base with me.

73
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,101
Wow, are you cooking?

74
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,684
Yes, I am.

75
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,657
Are you sure that's a good idea

76
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,644
after last time you looked really creepy without eyebrows.

77
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,719
I can handle this. So think you'll find I'm full of surprise tonight.

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,933
So there's more surprises? Like what?

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,588
Marshal was in the second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.

80
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,551
And that's all of them!

81
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,042
I'm going to go cook.

82
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,061
I'm so happy for Marshal. I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.

83
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,753
So do you think you'll ever get married?

84
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,406
Well, maybe eventually

85
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,171
Some fall day

86
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,780
possibly in Central Park

87
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,350
simple ceremony, we are better on vows.

88
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:51,827
band, no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it.

89
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:55,134
Damn it! Why did Marshal have to get engaged!

90
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:59,371
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his imaginary wedding.

91
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,632
Actually I think it's cute.

92
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,279
Well, you're clearly drunk.

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,648
One more for the lady.

94
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,301
Oh, hey, look what I got.

95
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,928
Oh, honey, champagne!

96
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:21,896
No, you're too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.

97
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:22,602
I'm not scared.

98
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,064
-Then open it.
-Fine.

99
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:26,984
Please open it.

100
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:29,421
You're unbelievalbe, Marshal ...

101
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,966
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life:

102
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:36,346
one you planned out for months, the other just slipps out when you're half drunk at some bar.

103
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:37,575
Will you marry me?

104
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,926
You want to go out sometime?

105
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:41,476
Of course, you idiot!

106
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

107
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,572
What's up, Carl?

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,658
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

109
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,558
Did you know there is a pop under your fridge?

110
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:00,093
No, but dips.

111
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:02,526
Where's that champagne?

112
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:04,850
I want to drink a toast

113
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:06,404
with my fiancee.

114
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,212
Hard to know I was so scared at this.

115
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,169
It's pretty easy, right?

116
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,101
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden. This is crazy. I'm not ready to get settled down.

117
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,122
How does Carl lend a Lebanese girl?

118
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:26,205
-The plan's always been, don't even think about it until you're 30.
-Exactly.

119
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,576
The guy doesn't even own a suit.

120
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,059
Plus, Marshal's found the love of his life.

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,934
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

122
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:33,610
but if I was, it's like,

123
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,534
'OK, I'm ready, where is she?'

124
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:42,397
And there she was.

125
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,419
It was like something from an old movie,

126
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,735
with a sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy, and says, 'see that girl?

127
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,531
I'm going to marry her some day.'

128
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:04,182
-Hey, Barney, See that girl?
-Oh, yeah, you just know that she likes dirty.

129
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:07,921
-Go say 'hi.'
-I can't just go say 'hi.'

130
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,324
I need a plan.

131
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,195
I'm going to wait until she goes to the bathroom.

132
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,235
I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...

133
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,173
Hi, have you met Ted?

134
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,185
Let me guess, Ted?

135
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,905
Sorry, Lily, I'm so sorry.

136
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:27,467
Take us to the hospital.

137
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,264
Did you hit her?

138
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,895
Hit me? Please!

139
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:35,393
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.

140
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,254
He's all like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt?'

141
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,571
And I'm like, 'Oh, come on! Let me have you, pansy.'

142
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,212
Wow, complete stranger.

143
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:45,055
No, it's OK, go on.

144
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:52,661
So, these spankings, in pajamas or all natural?

145
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,378
So what do you do?

146
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,853
I'm a reporter from Metronews One.

147
00:06:56,854 --> 00:07:00,378
Kind of a reporter.

148
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,703
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know, like,

149
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:05,332
monkey can play the ukulele.

150
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,025
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.

151
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,046
Bigger like, gorilla with an upright bass?

152
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,796
I'm sorry. You're really pretty.

153
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,503
Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.

154
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,139
Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend, so tonight,

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,983
every guy is the "enemy".

156
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:25,900
You know if it'll make your friend feel better, you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.

157
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,200
She would love that.

158
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,402
It does look fun in the movies.

159
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:33,654
Hey, you want to have dinner with me Saturday night?

160
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,941
Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

161
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:40,193
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake. Guess who's covering it?

162
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:42,538
-That's going to take a week?
-Yes. He's going to eat it, too. That's another record.

163
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,013
Hey, what's taking so long?

164
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,489
I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night?

165
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:56,741
Yeah, what the hell?

166
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,178
Jerk!

167
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,087
That was fun.

168
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,498
De -- wait for it -- nied!

169
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,171
Denied!

170
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,584
We're going out tomorrow night.

171
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,141
I thought we were playing laser attack tomorrow night!

172
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,945
Yeah, I was never going to play laser attack.

173
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,818
The next night, I took her out to this little in Brooklyn.

174
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,136
Wow, that is one bad ass boof French horn.

175
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,776
Yeah, so it looks like a penis.

176
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:30,141
Son, a piece of advice.

177
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,292
When you go on a first date, you really don't want to say 'penis.'

178
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:36,651
Girls don't ordinarilly like that.

179
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,554
But this was no ordinary girl.

180
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,900
Lily?

181
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,019
How have you been sitting there?

182
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:53,367
The stupid odd patch!

183
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,927
Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosbie!

184
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:56,910
Marshal, how have I always described my perfect woman?

185
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:58,705
I'll let see.

186
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,382
She likes dogs?

187
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:01,282
I've got 5 dogs.

188
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:03,864
She drinks scotch?

189
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,964
I love a scotch that's old enough to own it's own scotch.

190
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:09,729
Can quote obsure lines from 'Ghost Busters?'

191
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,893
'Ray, when someone ask you if you're God, you say yes!'

192
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,354
And I'm saving the best for last.

193
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,587
Do you want this? I hate olives.

194
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,203
She hates olives! Awesome!

195
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:22,069
The olive theory!

196
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,425
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshal and Lily.

197
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,898
He hates olives. She loves them. And that makes them such a great couple.

198
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:32,014
Perfect balance.

199
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,026
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.

200
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,458
I can take them off your hands.

201
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:42,480
They are all yours.

202
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:47,446
Oh, it is on! It is on till that breakup done!

203
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,802
Wait, it's only the break at 10:30. What happened?

204
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,789
I've got to get one of those boof French horns over my fireplace.

205
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,963
It's got to be blue. It's got to be French.

206
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,368
No green clarinet?

207
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,511
No purple tuba?

208
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,573
It's a penis. We are no dice.

209
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:03,503
There you are.

210
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:05,108
We got a jumper, some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

211
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08,208
Come on. You're covering it.

212
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,384
Alright, I'll be right there.

213
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,069
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:15,738
I had a really great time tonight.

215
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,213
Yeah.

216
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,325
So? Did you kiss her?

217
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:23,379
No, the moment wasn't right.

218
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,177
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife. I want our first kiss to be amazing.

219
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,244
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet!

220
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,131
So you chickened out like a little bitch.

221
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,626
What? I did not chicken out.

222
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,414
You know what? I don't need to take a first kiss advice from some pirate

223
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:40,261
who hasn't be single since the first week at college.

224
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,510
Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing.

225
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,817
Even the dumbest single person alive.

226
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:50,814
And if you don't believe me? Call him.

227
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,874
Hey, loser? How's not playing laser attack? Because playing laser attack is awesome!

228
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,813
I killed you, connered. I'll make me get your mom.

229
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:57,407
Listen, I need your opinion on something.

230
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,683
OK, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

231
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:01,947
Suit up!

232
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:02,881
So these guys think I chickened out.

233
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,718
What do you think?

234
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,792
I can't believe

235
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,048
you're still not waring a suit!

236
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,050
She didn't even give me the signal.

237
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,336
What? Is she going to bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

238
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,917
'Ted, kiss me.'

239
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,760
No, you just kiss her!

240
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,069
Not if you don't get the signal.

241
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,329
-Did Marshal give me the signal?
-No!

242
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:31,383
I didn't. I swear.

243
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:32,378
At least tonight I get to sleep knowing Marshal and me, never going to happen.

244
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,352
You should have kissed her.

245
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:36,186
I should have kissed her.

246
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,375
Maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.

247
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,565
A week? That's like a year in hot girl's time.

248
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,657
She'll forget all about you.

249
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,322
Mark my words, you'll never see that one again.

250
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,578
There she is!

251
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,040
Woo, she's cute. Carl, turn it up.

252
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:54,972
... him to reconsider

253
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:56,350
at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizzare story a happy ending.

254
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,555
Reporting from Metro 1 News ...

255
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,919
Didn't jump.

256
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:01,406
I'm going to kiss her.

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,430
Right now.

258
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:10,309
Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I might advice you that's freaking crazy.

259
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,362
I never do anything crazy. I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.

260
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:16,831
She's leaving tomorrow. This maybe the only chance I'm going to get.

261
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,128
I got to do what that guy couldn't. I got to take the leap.

262
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,474
OK, not a perfect metaphor.

263
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:22,375
Because for me it's falling in love and getting married and for him, it's

264
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,161
death.

265
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:27,823
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

266
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,842
By the way, could I congratulate you two?

267
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:32,197
I'm doing this.

268
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,972
Let's go.

269
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:35,768
-Where?
-We're coming with you.

270
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,463
Barney?

271
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,338
Alright. But under one condition.

272
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,181
Look at you, you beautiful bastard! You're suited up!

273
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,387
This is totally going in my block.

274
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,226
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

275
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:52,979
I got to do something.

276
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:55,672
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just say

277
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:58,920
enjoy your coffee.

278
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,740
Go, go, go!

279
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,007
Everybody brings flowers.

280
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:13,012
OK, the moment of truth.

281
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:15,511
Wish me luck.

282
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,015
Ted's going to get it on a with a TV reporter.

283
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,390
'It's just in.' OK...

284
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:24,816
Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good!

285
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,446
Kiss the crap out of that girl!

286
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,827
Marshal, remember this night.

287
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,156
And you're the best man at our wedding. You give a speech. You're going to tell this story.

288
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,293
Why does he get to be the best man?

289
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,676
I'm your best friend!

290
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:43,332
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raised to my mind.

291
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,071
Unfortunately one particular thought did not.

292
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:48,398
I've got 5 dogs.

293
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,047
Not good, not good ...

294
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,650
-No!
-Get back in there!

295
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,170
You're wearing a suit!

296
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:58,118
Ted?

297
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,092
Hi!

298
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,351
I was just

299
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,460
come on up.

300
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,929
He's in.

301
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,923
So, Ranjit

302
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,297
You must have done that with a Lebanese girl.

303
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,565
OK, that's my Barney. Let me

304
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,884
I'm going to see if that has a bathroom.

305
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,890
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

306
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,478
The women hot there?

307
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:32,285
Here's a picture of my wife.

308
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,017
He'll know what he sufficed.

309
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:41,122
She's lovely.

310
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:43,933
So Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1 in the morning in a suit?

311
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,731
I was just hoping to

312
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,045
get those olives.

313
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:53,414
We shall have these olives with some gin and vermuth?

314
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:58,854
Are you trying to get me drunk?

315
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,617
We're starters.

316
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,293
So Marshal,

317
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:10,130
-This olive theory, based on you and Lily?
-Yeah.

318
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:13,118
You hate olives. Lily loves them. You can't stand them?

319
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,468
Yeah, I hate olives.

320
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:18,182
Two weeks ago, Spanish Bar at 79th Street, dish of olive, you had some.

321
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,972
What up!

322
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:24,850
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.

323
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:25,810
I swear.

324
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,135
I swear.

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,555
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad. Lily asked if she could have my olives.

326
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:36,312
I said, 'sure, I hate olives.'

327
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:37,789
But you like olives.

328
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,359
Well, I was 18, OK? I was a virgin.

329
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,042
I've been waiting my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.

330
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:47,028
Marshal, I'm going to give you an early wedding present

331
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,006
Don't get married.

332
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,218
I think I like your olive theory.

333
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,015
I think I like your French horn.

334
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,919
I think I like your nose.

335
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,980
I think I'm in love with you.

336
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,025
What?

337
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:09,951
What?

338
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:10,822
What?

339
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:14,267
Come on, man! You said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is.

340
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:18,484
Hunger. You're hungry for experience, hungry for something new,

341
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,887
hungry for olives.

342
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,991
But you're too scared to do anything about it.

343
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:26,238
Yeah, I'm scared, OK?

344
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:29,286
But I want to get to spending the rest of my life with Lily.

345
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,948
committing forever.

346
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,330
It doesn't scare me at all.

347
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm marrying that girl.

348
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,625
Lily,

349
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,249
Lily, I like olives.

350
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,578
We'll make it work.

351
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,886
So Orlando, you're going to hit this new world?

352
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,058
You love me?

353
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,503
I can't believe I said that.

354
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:06,743
Why did I say that?

355
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:07,941
Who says that?

356
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:09,718
I should just go.

357
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:12,289
Hold on. Wait a minute.

358
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,043
I promised these.

359
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,333
-Olives.
-Yes.

360
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,269
Thanks. I love you.

361
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,507
What is wrong with me!

362
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,351
Why we are still sitting here?

363
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:25,867
Let' go. We can still make a last call.

364
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:26,707
What do you sayï¼ŒLilï¼Ÿ

365
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,258
Yuhoho, and a bottle of rum!

366
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,024
Because you're a pirate?

367
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,230
OK, I patch gone.

368
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,873
We can't just abandon Ted.

369
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,747
If it doesn't go well up there, he's going to need some support.

370
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,193
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

371
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:43,830
You think they're doing it?

372
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:46,221
-You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?
-Doggy style?

373
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,112
There is a girl in college who had this golden retriever ...

374
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,509
OK, we can go to the bar. Just stop talking.

375
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,369
Hit it, Ranjie.

376
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,919
So when you tell this to your friends,

377
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,617
could you avoid the word, 'psycho?'

378
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,550
I'd prefer 'eccentric.'

379
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,943
Good night, psycho.

380
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:12,239
Great.

381
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,015
How do we get the train?

382
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,016
Two blocks. That way and take a right.

383
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,632
You know what?

384
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:25,545
I'm done being single.

385
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:27,405
I'm not good at it.

386
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,301
Obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.

387
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,021
But

388
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,936
it sucks that you can't.

389
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,178
I'll tell you something new, if a woman

390
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,676
not you, just some hypothetical woman

391
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:42,278
would bear with me through all this,

392
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:44,582
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

393
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,352
Because that's the stuff I'd be good at,

394
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,755
stuff like, making her laugh and being a good father

395
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,202
and her 5 hypothetical dogs,

396
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:55,994
and being a good kisser.

397
00:18:57,728 --> 00:18:59,276
Everyone thinks he's a good kisser.

398
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,516
I've got references.

399
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:02,996
Good night, Ted.

400
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,965
And I'm a good handshaker.

401
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,449
That's a pretty good handshake.

402
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:20,091
And that was it. I'll never see her again.

403
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:23,939
What?

404
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,292
That was the signal!

405
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,505
That long, lingering handshake! You should have kissed her!

406
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,180
There's no such thing as the signal.

407
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,920
But yeah, that was the signal.

408
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:34,954
Signal.

409
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:37,810
Carl, thank you.

410
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,408
Something I got to do?

411
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,651
By the way,

412
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:42,684
you should have kissed her.

413
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:45,314
Carl, you guys weren't there!

414
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,440
I am so turned on right now.

415
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,785
Guys, trust me! I've seen the signal.

416
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,518
That was not the signal!

417
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,140
Yeah, Ted, we're not on your anymore.

418
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,865
To my fiancee.

419
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,602
To the future.

420
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,497
To one the hell of a night.

421
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,990
That was not the signal!

422
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:10,735
I asked her about it years later

423
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,885
and yeah, that was the signal.

424
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:14,073
I could have kissed her.

425
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:16,109
But that's the funny thing about destiny.

426
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,074
It happens whether you plan it or not.

427
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:19,958
I mean I never thought I'd see that girl again.

428
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:24,369
But it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was formal.

429
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,958
Bacause that, kids, is the true story

430
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,771
of how I met your aunt Robin.

431
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,291
Aunt Robin?

432
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,352
I thought this was how you met mom.

433
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:35,406
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

434
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:39,121
Like I said, it's a long story.
