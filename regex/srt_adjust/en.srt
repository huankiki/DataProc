1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:02,241


2
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:06,103
Kids, I'm going to tell you an incredible story.

3
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:08,764
the story of how I met your mother.

4
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:10,684
Are we being punished for something?

5
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:11,846
No.

6
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,464
-Is this going to take a while?
-Yes.

7
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:19,725
25 years ago, before I was dad,
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,869
 

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,161


10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,104
It was way back to 2005.

11
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:31,953
I was 27ï¼Œjust starting to make it as an architect and living in New York with Marshal, my best friend from college.

12
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:35,657
My life was good, and then uncle Marshal went to screw the whole thing up.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,506
Will you marry me?

14
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:42,086
Yes, perfect, and you're engaged.

15
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:45,419
You pop up the champagne. You drink a toast. You have sex on the kitchen floor.

16
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:47,349
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

17
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:48,345
Got it.

18
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:50,202
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

19
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:52,473
Are you kidding? It's you and Lily!

20
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,746
I've been there for all the big moment of you and Lily.

21
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,467
The night you met, your first date,

22
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,242
other first things.

23
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,365
Sorry, we thought you were asleep.

24
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,032
It's physics, Marshal. If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.

25
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,326
My God!

26
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,951
You're getting engaged tonight!

27
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:13,768
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,234
What are you doing tonight?

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,706
What was I doing?

30
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:21,301
Your uncle Marshal was taking the biggest step of his life. And me?

31
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:23,232
I'm calling up your uncle Barney.

32
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:26,354
Hey, see, you know, however, I thought I had a thing for half Asian girls?


33
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:29,701
Well, now I've got a new favourite,

34
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:31,688
Lebanese girls.

35
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,135
Lebanese girls are the new half Asians.

36
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:36,568
Hey, you want to do something tonight?

37
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,641
OK, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes,

38
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:39,402
and suit up!

39
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:43,180
Hey.

40
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:44,980
Where is your suit?

41
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,148
-Just once when I say 'suit up', I wish you'd put on a suit.
-I did, that one time.

42
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,388
It was a blazer.

43
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,099
You know, ever since college it's been Marshal and Lily and me.

44
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,382
Now it's going to be Marshal and Lily, and me.

45
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:00,988
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,490
Before long I'm that weird, middle-aged bechalor, their kids call 'uncle Ted'.

47
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,174
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,471
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?

49
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,276
Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live.

50
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,082
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,417
Oh, alright.

52
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:20,972
Alright.

53
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,774
Lesson one, lose the goatee.

54
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,003
It doesn't go with your suit.

55
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,683
-I'm not wearing a suit.
-Lesson two, get a suit.

56
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,711
Suits are cool, exhibitive.

57
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:33,855
Lesson 3, don't even think about getting married till you're 30.

58
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,202
30, right, you're right.

59
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:39,570
I guess that just your best friends get engaged, you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,872
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,561
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:46,720
-You're my best friend, Barney.
-Good,

63
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,646
and as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game I'd like to call 

64
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:52,943
-'have you met Ted'.
-No, we are not playing 'have you met Ted.'

65
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:53,802
Hi, have you met Ted?

66
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,343
Hi!

67
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,583
I'm Ted.

68
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:58,780
Yasmin.

69
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,859
It's a very pretty name.

70
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,739
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

71
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:10,618
I'm exhausted. It was finger painting day at school.

72
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,679
A 5-year-old boy got to second base with me.

73
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,263
Wow, are you cooking?

74
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:18,914
Yes, I am.

75
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:23,057
Are you sure that's a good idea

76
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:26,171
after last time you looked really creepy without eyebrows.

77
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,378
I can handle this. So think you'll find I'm full of surprise tonight.

78
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,686
So there's more surprises? Like what?

79
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,540
Marshal was in the second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.

80
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,629
And that's all of them!

81
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,270
I'm going to go cook.

82
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:48,503
I'm so happy for Marshal. I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.

83
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,267
So do you think you'll ever get married?

84
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:51,991
Well, maybe eventually

85
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,831
Some fall day

86
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:55,509
possibly in Central Park

87
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,189
simple ceremony, we are better on vows.

88
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:01,814
band, no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it.

89
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:05,262
Damn it! Why did Marshal have to get engaged!

90
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his imaginary wedding.

91
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,038
Actually I think it's cute.

92
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,755
Well, you're clearly drunk.

93
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,183
One more for the lady.

94
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,949
Oh, hey, look what I got.

95
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,859
Oh, honey, champagne!

96
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:33,167
No, you're too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.

97
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:33,904
I'm not scared.

98
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,428
-Then open it.
-Fine.

99
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:38,473
Please open it.

100
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,014
You're unbelievalbe, Marshal ...

101
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,667
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life:

102
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:48,235
one you planned out for months, the other just slipps out when you're half drunk at some bar.

103
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,516
Will you marry me?

104
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,925
You want to go out sometime?

105
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,584
Of course, you idiot!

106
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,352
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

107
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:00,983
What's up, Carl?

108
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,329
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

109
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:11,395
Did you know there is a pop under your fridge?

110
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:12,996
No, but dips.

111
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,533
Where's that champagne?

112
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:17,956
I want to drink a toast

113
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:19,576
with my fiancee.

114
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,590
Hard to know I was so scared at this.

115
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,630
It's pretty easy, right?

116
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,858
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden. This is crazy. I'm not ready to get settled down.

117
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,966
How does Carl lend a Lebanese girl?

118
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:40,223
-The plan's always been, don't even think about it until you're 30.
-Exactly.

119
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:41,653
The guy doesn't even own a suit.

120
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,242
Plus, Marshal's found the love of his life.

121
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,197
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

122
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:47,944
but if I was, it's like,

123
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:50,993
'OK, I'm ready, where is she?'

124
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,107
And there she was.

125
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,016
It was like something from an old movie,

126
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:12,602
with a sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy, and says, 'see that girl? 

127
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,475
I'm going to marry her some day.'

128
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:20,367
-Hey, Barney, See that girl?
-Oh, yeah, you just know that she likes dirty.

129
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:24,266
-Go say 'hi.'
-I can't just go say 'hi.'

130
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,729
I need a plan.

131
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm going to wait until she goes to the bathroom.

132
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,807
I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...

133
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:30,785
Hi, have you met Ted?

134
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,097
Let me guess, Ted?

135
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,018
Sorry, Lily, I'm so sorry.

136
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,647
Take us to the hospital.

137
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:46,521
Did you hit her?

138
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,307
Hit me? Please!

139
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,911
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.

140
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,894
He's all like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt?' 

141
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,310
And I'm like, 'Oh, come on! Let me have you, pansy.'

142
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,064
Wow, complete stranger.

143
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:02,986
No, it's OK, go on.

144
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:08,017
So, these spankings, in pajamas or all natural?

145
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:10,917
So what do you do?

146
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,707
I'm a reporter from Metronews One.

147
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:15,288
Kind of a reporter.

148
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,963
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know, like,

149
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:21,388
monkey can play the ukulele.

150
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,129
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.

151
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,937
Bigger like, gorilla with an upright bass?

152
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,044
I'm sorry. You're really pretty.

153
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:35,040
Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.

154
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,862
Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend, so tonight,

155
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,568
every guy is the "enemy".

156
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:43,577
You know if it'll make your friend feel better, you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.

157
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,575
She would love that.

158
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:47,974
It does look fun in the movies.

159
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,270
Hey, you want to have dinner with me Saturday night?

160
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,661
Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

161
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:57,088
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake. Guess who's covering it?

162
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,479
-That's going to take a week?
-Yes. He's going to eat it, too. That's another record.

163
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:02,924
Hey, what's taking so long?

164
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,547
I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night?

165
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,172
Yeah, what the hell?

166
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:17,734
Jerk!

167
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,275
That was fun.

168
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,351
De -- wait for it -- nied!

169
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:25,822
Denied!

170
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,566
We're going out tomorrow night.

171
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,082
I thought we were playing laser attack tomorrow night!

172
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,749
Yeah, I was never going to play laser attack.

173
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:38,800
The next night, I took her out to this little in Brooklyn.

174
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,839
Wow, that is one bad ass boof French horn.

175
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,299
Yeah, so it looks like a penis.

176
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,051
Son, a piece of advice.

177
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,560
When you go on a first date, you really don't want to say 'penis.'

178
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,803
Girls don't ordinarilly like that.

179
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,348
But this was no ordinary girl.

180
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,461
Lily?

181
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,949
How have you been sitting there?

182
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,159
The stupid odd patch!

183
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:16,778
Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosbie!

184
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,447
Marshal, how have I always described my perfect woman?

185
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:20,472
I'll let see.

186
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,344
She likes dogs?

187
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,093
I've got 5 dogs.

188
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:25,031
She drinks scotch?

189
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,723
I love a scotch that's old enough to own it's own scotch.

190
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,913
Can quote obsure lines from 'Ghost Busters?'

191
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:33,839
'Ray, when someone ask you if you're God, you say yes!'

192
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,138
And I'm saving the best for last.

193
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,704
Do you want this? I hate olives.

194
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,033
She hates olives! Awesome!

195
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,717
The olive theory!

196
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,706
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshal and Lily.

197
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:50,205
He hates olives. She loves them. And that makes them such a great couple.

198
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:51,741
Perfect balance.

199
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,076
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.

200
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,216
I can take them off your hands.

201
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,752
They are all yours.

202
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:07,989
Oh, it is on! It is on till that breakup done!

203
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:13,167
Wait, it's only the break at 10:30. What happened?

204
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:17,709
I've got to get one of those boof French horns over my fireplace.

205
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,781
It's got to be blue. It's got to be French.

206
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,005
No green clarinet?

207
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,470
No purple tuba?

208
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,704
It's a penis. We are no dice.

209
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:26,854
There you are.

210
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:29,910
We got a jumper, some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

211
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,583
Come on. You're covering it.

212
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,816
Alright, I'll be right there.

213
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,084
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,884
I had a really great time tonight.

215
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,667
Yeah.

216
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,205
So? Did you kiss her?

217
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:46,407
No, the moment wasn't right.

218
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:50,634
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife. I want our first kiss to be amazing.

219
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,552
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet!

220
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,707
So you chickened out like a little bitch.

221
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,760
What? I did not chicken out.

222
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:03,404
You know what? I don't need to take a first kiss advice from some pirate

223
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:05,269
who hasn't be single since the first week at college.

224
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,237
Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing.

225
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,582
Even the dumbest single person alive.

226
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,988
And if you don't believe me? Call him.

227
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:19,241
Hey, loser? How's not playing laser attack? Because playing laser attack is awesome!

228
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:22,432
I killed you, connered. I'll make me get your mom.

229
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,454
Listen, I need your opinion on something.

230
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,116
OK, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

231
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,446
Suit up!

232
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,850
So these guys think I chickened out.

233
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:31,824
What do you think?

234
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,739
I can't believe

235
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,902
you're still not waring a suit!

236
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,254
She didn't even give me the signal.

237
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:41,384
What? Is she going to bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

238
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:44,810
'Ted, kiss me.'

239
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,459
No, you just kiss her!

240
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,381
Not if you don't get the signal.

241
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,916
-Did Marshal give me the signal?
-No!

242
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,273
I didn't. I swear.

243
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,543
At least tonight I get to sleep knowing Marshal and me, never going to happen.

244
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,580
You should have kissed her.

245
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,639
I should have kissed her.

246
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,551
Maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.

247
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,833
A week? That's like a year in hot girl's time.

248
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:10,074
She'll forget all about you.

249
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:13,298
Mark my words, you'll never see that one again.

250
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,034
There she is!

251
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,429
Woo, she's cute. Carl, turn it up.

252
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:20,997
... him to reconsider

253
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:26,139
at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizzare story a happy ending.

254
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,576
Reporting from Metro 1 News ...

255
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:28,833
Didn't jump.

256
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:31,298
I'm going to kiss her.

257
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,848
Right now.

258
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:38,087
Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I might advice you that's freaking crazy.

259
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:42,131
I never do anything crazy. I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.

260
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,315
She's leaving tomorrow. This maybe the only chance I'm going to get.

261
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,932
I got to do what that guy couldn't. I got to take the leap.

262
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:51,327
OK, not a perfect metaphor.

263
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,773
Because for me it's falling in love and getting married and for him, it's

264
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:54,713
death.

265
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,618
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

266
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,393
By the way, could I congratulate you two?

267
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,541
I'm doing this.

268
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,954
Let's go.

269
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:06,805
-Where?
-We're coming with you.

270
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,678
Barney?

271
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:12,530
Alright. But under one condition.

272
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,571
Look at you, you beautiful bastard! You're suited up!

273
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,493
This is totally going in my block.

274
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,836
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

275
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,796
I got to do something.

276
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:26,624
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just say

277
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:29,432
enjoy your coffee.

278
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,818
Go, go, go!

279
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:37,844
Everybody brings flowers.

280
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:48,972
OK, the moment of truth.

281
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,063
Wish me luck.

282
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,668
Ted's going to get it on a with a TV reporter.

283
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,322
'It's just in.' OK...

284
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,884
Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good!

285
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,371
Kiss the crap out of that girl!

286
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,071
Marshal, remember this night.

287
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,639
And you're the best man at our wedding. You give a speech. You're going to tell this story.

288
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,110
Why does he get to be the best man?

289
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,338
I'm your best friend!

290
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,908
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raised to my mind.

291
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,678
Unfortunately one particular thought did not.

292
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,491
I've got 5 dogs.

293
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:27,960
Not good, not good ...

294
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,679
-No!
-Get back in there!

295
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,351
You're wearing a suit!

296
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,064
Ted?

297
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:38,095
Hi!

298
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,239
I was just

299
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,723
come on up.

300
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:50,964
He's in.

301
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,581
So, Ranjit

302
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,661
You must have done that with a Lebanese girl.

303
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,136
OK, that's my Barney. Let me 

304
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,501
I'm going to see if that has a bathroom.

305
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:04,962
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

306
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,053
The women hot there?

307
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,752
Here's a picture of my wife.

308
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:13,722
He'll know what he sufficed.

309
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,570
She's lovely.

310
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:22,936
So Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1 in the morning in a suit?

311
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,867
I was just hoping to 

312
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:29,827
get those olives.

313
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:33,283
We shall have these olives with some gin and vermuth?

314
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,753
Are you trying to get me drunk?

315
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,425
We're starters.

316
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,225
So Marshal,

317
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:53,183
-This olive theory, based on you and Lily?
-Yeah.

318
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:56,298
You hate olives. Lily loves them. You can't stand them?

319
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,706
Yeah, I hate olives.

320
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,579
Two weeks ago, Spanish Bar at 79th Street, dish of olive, you had some.

321
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,402
What up!

322
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,532
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.

323
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,533
I swear.

324
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:10,914
I swear.

325
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:17,608
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad. Lily asked if she could have my olives.

326
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,483
I said, 'sure, I hate olives.'

327
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,023
But you like olives.

328
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,703
Well, I was 18, OK? I was a virgin.

329
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:27,500
I've been waiting my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.

330
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:31,657
Marshal, I'm going to give you an early wedding present

331
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,719
Don't get married.

332
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,367
I think I like your olive theory.

333
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,284
I think I like your French horn.

334
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,312
I think I like your nose.

335
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,504
I think I'm in love with you.

336
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:54,593
What?

337
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:55,559
What?

338
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,467
What?

339
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:00,059
Come on, man! You said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is.

340
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,456
Hunger. You're hungry for experience, hungry for something new,

341
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,962
hungry for olives.

342
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:10,198
But you're too scared to do anything about it.

343
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,541
Yeah, I'm scared, OK?

344
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:15,720
But I want to get to spending the rest of my life with Lily.

345
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,538
committing forever.

346
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,022
It doesn't scare me at all.

347
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm marrying that girl.

348
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:27,543
Lily,

349
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,279
Lily, I like olives.

350
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,707
We'll make it work.

351
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,626
So Orlando, you're going to hit this new world?

352
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,934
You love me?

353
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,483
I can't believe I said that.

354
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:54,776
Why did I say that?

355
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,025
Who says that?

356
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:57,878
I should just go.

357
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,559
Hold on. Wait a minute.

358
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,474
I promised these.

359
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,819
-Olives.
-Yes.

360
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,837
Thanks. I love you.

361
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,128
What is wrong with me!

362
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,136
Why we are still sitting here?

363
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,717
Let' go. We can still make a last call.

364
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,593
What do you sayï¼ŒLilï¼Ÿ

365
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,253
Yuhoho, and a bottle of rum!

366
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,180
Because you're a pirate?

367
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:24,480
OK, I patch gone.

368
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,236
We can't just abandon Ted.

369
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,233
If it doesn't go well up there, he's going to need some support.

370
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,740
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

371
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:33,447
You think they're doing it?

372
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,940
-You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?
-Doggy style?

373
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,955
There is a girl in college who had this golden retriever ...

374
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,454
OK, we can go to the bar. Just stop talking.

375
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,351
Hit it, Ranjie.

376
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:50,223
So when you tell this to your friends,

377
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,994
could you avoid the word, 'psycho?'

378
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,052
I'd prefer 'eccentric.'

379
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,547
Good night, psycho.

380
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,070
Great.

381
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,921
How do we get the train?

382
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,093
Two blocks. That way and take a right.

383
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:13,906
You know what?

384
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:16,944
I'm done being single.

385
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,883
I'm not good at it.

386
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,946
Obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.

387
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:23,696
But

388
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,693
it sucks that you can't.

389
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,074
I'll tell you something new, if a woman

390
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,678
not you, just some hypothetical woman

391
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,392
would bear with me through all this,

392
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,794
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

393
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,640
Because that's the stuff I'd be good at,

394
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:42,188
stuff like, making her laugh and being a good father

395
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:45,782
and her 5 hypothetical dogs,

396
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:48,693
and being a good kisser.

397
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,116
Everyone thinks he's a good kisser.

398
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,408
I've got references.

399
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,994
Good night, Ted.

400
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,304
And I'm a good handshaker.

401
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,894
That's a pretty good handshake.

402
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,820
And that was it. I'll never see her again.

403
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:17,832
What?

404
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,243
That was the signal!

405
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:22,593
That long, lingering handshake! You should have kissed her!

406
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,382
There's no such thing as the signal.

407
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:27,196
But yeah, that was the signal.

408
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:29,317
Signal.

409
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,295
Carl, thank you.

410
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:33,962
Something I got to do?

411
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,300
By the way,

412
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,377
you should have kissed her.

413
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:40,120
Carl, you guys weren't there!

414
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:44,422
I am so turned on right now.

415
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:47,910
Guys, trust me! I've seen the signal.

416
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:49,717
That was not the signal!

417
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,408
Yeah, Ted, we're not on your anymore.

418
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,249
To my fiancee.

419
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,061
To the future.

420
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,037
To one the hell of a night.

421
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,764
That was not the signal!

422
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,626
I asked her about it years later

423
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:08,868
and yeah, that was the signal.

424
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,107
I could have kissed her.

425
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,230
But that's the funny thing about destiny.

426
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,279
It happens whether you plan it or not.

427
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,243
I mean I never thought I'd see that girl again.

428
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:20,843
But it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was formal.

429
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:23,542
Bacause that, kids, is the true story

430
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,433
of how I met your aunt Robin.

431
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:28,060
Aunt Robin?

432
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,209
I thought this was how you met mom.

433
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,351
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

434
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:36,225
Like I said, it's a long story.
